# Antimicrobial stewardship programs in pediatric emergency department

## Introduction

ASP programs are a comprehensive set of tools to improve antibiotic prescription

## AMR around the world

::: {.column width="50%"}

Study design
This is a before and after study conducted at Pediatric Emergency Department at the Department of Women's and Children's Health at Padua University Hospital.

::: 

:::{.column width="50%"}

Intervention
Clinical pathways for the management of acute otitis media, pharyngitis and community acquired pneumonia were implemented in October 2015.

## Results

:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Demographic characteristics

We collected data of more than 500 children evaluated in pediatric emergency department between October 2014 and September 2016

No differences in demographics characteristics where observed between the groups

## Antibiotic prescriptions

Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid reduced whereas amoxicillin prescription increase

The use of second and third generation cephalosporins decreased in the post implementation period

## Treatment Failure

No difference in the treatment failure between the two groups was observed at the follow-up phone

:::

## Conclusions

Our study showed that the implementation of CP for the management of the most common pediatric infectious diseases improved antibiotic prescription, without affecting patients outcome
