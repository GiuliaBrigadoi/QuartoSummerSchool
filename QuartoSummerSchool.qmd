# **The fight against Antimicrobial resistance**

## ***What is antimicrobial resistance?***

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites evolve to resist the effects of antimicrobials that were previously effective in treating or preventing infections^1,2^.

### *Bacterial AMR*

ESKAPE is an acronym comprising the scientific names of six highly virulent and antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens including: *Escherichia coli*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Acinetobacter baumannii*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and *Enterococcus faecium*, *Enterococcus faecium*
