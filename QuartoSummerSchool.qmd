# **The fight against Antimicrobial resistance**

## ***What is antimicrobial resistance?***

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites evolve to resist the effects of antimicrobials that were previously effective in treating or preventing infections^1,2^.

### *Bacterial AMR*

ESKAPE is an acronym comprising the scientific names of six highly virulent and antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens including: *Escherichia coli*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Acinetobacter baumannii*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and *Enterococcus faecium*, *Enterococcus faecium*

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
